# Android ML UI Templates
A set of UI samples for implementing TensorFlow Lite ML models on Android ML.

Provide best practices on UI components for common computer vision scenarios, for example, 
* use CameraX for photo capture or preview frames
* select photos from gallery
* quick testing using a photo from assets or drawables
* data persistence to local storage which enables image saving and sharing
* UI Navigation using JetPack nav components 
* Asynchronous handling especially when the model inference is slow
