# Android ML UI Templates
A set of UI samples for implementing TensorFlow Lite ML models on Android, in particular for computer vision.

Provide best practices of UI design patterns for common computer vision scenarios:
* Quick testing using a photo from assets or drawables 
* CameraX for photo capture or preview frames
* Select photos from the gallery
* Data persistence to local storage which enables image saving and sharing
* UI navigation using JetPack Nav Component 
* Asynchronous handling with Kotlin Coroutine, especially when the model inference is slow
